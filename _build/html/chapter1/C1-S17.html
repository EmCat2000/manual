  <p>libraries. To include a library in your project, choose the Libraries…
option in the file ( ) menu.</p>
<p>When you click on the one-line description of a library, you are shown
the actual blocks in the library and a longer explanation of its
purpose. You can browse the libraries to find one that will satisfy your
needs.</p>
<p>The libraries and their contents may change, but as of this writing the
list library has these blocks:</p>
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image387.png" style="width:177px; height:239px">
 (The lightning bolt before the name in
several of these blocks means that they use compiled HOFs or JavaScript
primitives to achieve optimal speed. They are officially considered
experimental.) Remove duplicates from reports a list in which no two
items are equal. The sort block takes a list and a two-input comparison
predicate, such as \<, and reports a list with the items sorted
according to that comparison. The assoc block is for looking up a key in
an *association list:* a list of two-item lists. In each two-item list,
the first is a *key* and the second is a *value.* The inputs are a key
and an association list; the block reports the first key-value pair
whose key is equal to the input key.
<p>For each item is a variant of the primitive version that provides a #
variable containing the position in the input list of the currently
considered item. Multimap is a version of map that allows multiple list
inputs, in which case the mapping function must take as many inputs as
there are lists; it will be called with all the first items, all the
second items, and so on. Zip takes any number of lists as inputs; it
reports a list of lists: all the first items, all the second items, and
so on. The no-name identity function reports its input.</p>
<p>Sentence and sentence➔list are borrowed from the word and sentence
library (page 27) to serve as a variant of append that accepts non-lists
as inputs. Printable takes a list structure of any depth as input and
reports a compact representation of the list as a text string.</p>
<p>The iteration, composition library has these blocks:</p>
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image388.png" style="width:162px; height:456px">
Catch and throw provide a nonlocal exit facility. You
can drag the tag from a catch block to a throw inside its C-slot, and
the throw will then jump directly out to the matching catch without
doing anything in between.
<p>If do and pause all is for setting a breakpoint while debugging code.
The idea is to put show variable blocks for local variables in the
C-slot; the watchers will be deleted when the user continues from the
pause.</p>
<p>Ignore is used when you need to call a reporter but you don’t care about
the value it reports. (For example, you are writing a script to time how
long the reporter takes.)</p>
<p>The cascade blocks take an initial value and call a function repeatedly
on that value, <em>f</em>(<em>f</em>(<em>f</em>(<em>f</em>…(<em>x</em>)))).</p>
<p>The compose block takes two functions and reports the function
<em>f</em>(<em>g</em>(<em>x</em>)).</p>
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image389.png" style="width:100px; height:15px">
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image390.png" style="width:303px; height:29px">
The first three repeat blocks are variants
of the primitive repeat until block, giving all four combinations of
whether the first test happens before or after the first repetition, and
whether the condition must be true or false to continue repeating. The
last repeat block is like the repeat primitive, but makes the number of
repetitions so far available to the repeated script. The next two blocks
are variations on for: the first allows an explicit step instead of
using ±1, and the second allows any values, not just numbers; inside the
script you say
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image391.png" style="width:330px; height:131px">
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image392.png" style="width:356px; height:112px">
replacing the grey block in the picture
with an expression to give the next desired value for the loop index.
Pipe allows reordering a nested composition with a left-to-right one:
<p>The stream library has these blocks:</p>
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image393.png" style="width:303px; height:207px">
*Streams* are a special kind of list whose
items are not computed until they are needed. This makes certain
computations more efficient, and also allows the creation of lists with
infinitely many items, such as a list of all the positive integers. The
first five blocks are stream versions of the list blocks in front of,
item 1 of, all but first of, map, and keep. Show stream takes a stream
and a number as inputs, and reports an ordinary list of the first *n*
items of the stream. Stream is like the primitive list; it makes a
finite stream from explicit items. Sieve is an example block that takes
as input the stream of integers starting with 2 and reports the stream
of all the prime numbers. Stream with numbers from is like the numbers
from block for lists, except that there is no endpoint; it reports an
infinite stream of numbers.
<p>The word and sentence library has these blocks:</p>
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image394.png" style="width:161px; height:350px">
This library has the goal of recreating
the Logo approach to handling text: A text isn't best viewed as a string
of characters, but rather as a *sentence*, made of *words,* each of
which is a string of *letters.* With a few specialized exceptions, this
is why people put text into computers: The text is sentences of natural
(i.e., human) language, and the emphasis is on words as constitutive of
sentences. You barely notice the letters of the words, and you don't
notice the spaces between them at all, unless you're proof-reading.
(Even then: Proofreading is *diffciult,* because you see what you expect
to see, what will make the snetence make sense, rather than the
misspelling in front of of your eyes.) Internally, Logo stores a
sentence as a list of words, and a word as a string of letters.
<p>Inexplicably, the designers of Scratch chose to abandon that tradition,
and to focus on the representation of text as a string of characters.
The one vestige of the Logo tradition from which Scratch developed is
the block named letter (1) of (world), rather than character (1) of
(world). Snap*!* inherits its text handling from Scratch.</p>
<p>In Logo, the visual representation of a sentence (a list of words) looks
like a natural language sentence: a string of words with spaces between
them. In Snap*!*, the visual representation of a list looks nothing at
all like natural language. On the other hand, representing a sentence as
a string means that the program must continually re-parse the text on
every operation, looking for spaces, treating multiple consecutive
spaces as one, and so on. Also, it’s more convenient to treat a sentence
as a list of words rather than a string of words because in the former
case you can use the higher order functions map, keep, and combine on
them. This library attempts to be agnostic as to the internal
representation of sentences. The sentence selectors accept any
combination of lists and strings; there are two sentence constructors,
one to make a string (join words) and one to make a list (sentence).</p>
<p>The selector names come from Logo, and should be self-explanatory.
However, because in a block language you don’t have to type the block
name, instead of the terse butfirst or the cryptic bf we spell out “all
but first of” and include “word” or “sentence” to indicate the intended
domain. There’s no first letter of block because letter 1 of serves that
need. Join words (the sentence-as-string constructor) is like the
primitive join except that it puts a space in the reported value between
each of the inputs. Sentence (the List-colored sentence-as-list
constructor) accepts any number of inputs, which can be words,
sentences-as-lists, or sentences-as-strings. (If inputs are lists of
lists, only one level of flattening is done.) Sentence reports a list of
words; there will be no empty words or words containing spaces. The four
blocks with right-arrows in their names convert back and forth between
text strings (words or sentences) and lists. (Splitting a word into a
list of letters is unusual unless you’re a linguist investigating
orthography.) Printable takes a list (including a deep list) of words as
input and reports a text string in which parentheses are used to show
the structure, as in Lisp/Scheme.</p>
<p>The pixels library has one block:</p>
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image395.png" style="width:75px; height:60px">
Costumes are first class data in Snap*!*.
Most of the processing of costume data is done by primitive blocks in
the Looks category. (See page 79.) This library provides snap, which
takes a picture using your computer's camera and reports it as a
costume.
<p>The bar charts library has these blocks:</p>
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image396.png" style="width:329px; height:184px">
Bar chart takes a table (typically from a
CSV data set) as input and reports a summary of the table grouped by the
field in the specified column number. The remaining three inputs are
used only if the field values are numbers, in which case they can be
grouped into buckets (e.g., decades, centuries, etc.). Those inputs
specify the smallest and largest values of interest and, most
importantly, the width of a bucket (10 for decades, 100 for centuries).
If the field isn\'t numeric, leave these three inputs empty or set them
to zero. Each string value of the field is its own bucket, and they
appear sorted alphabetically.
<p>Bar chart reports a new table with three columns. The first column
contains the bucket name or smallest number. The second column contains
a nonnegative integer that says how many records in the input table fall
into this bucket. The third column is a subtable containing the actual
records from the original table that fall into the bucket. Plot bar
chart takes the table reported by bar chart and graphs it on the stage,
with axes labelled appropriately. The remaining blocks are helpers for
those.</p>
<p>If your buckets aren’t of constant width, or you want to group by some
function of more than one field, load the “Frequency Distribution
Analysis” library instead.</p>
<p>The multi-branched conditional library has these blocks:</p>
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image397.png" style="width:178px; height:238px">
The catch and throw blocks duplicate ones
in the iteration library, and are included because they are used to
implement the others. The cases block sets up a multi-branch
conditional, similar to cond in Lisp or switch in C-family languages.
The first branch is built into the cases block; it consists of a Boolean
test in the first hexagonal slot and an action script, in the C-slot, to
be run if the test reports true. The remaining branches go in the
variadic hexagonal input at the end; each branch consists of an else if
block, which includes the Boolean test and the corresponding action
script, except possibly for the last branch, which can use the
unconditional else block. As in other languages, once a branch succeeds,
no other branches are tested.

<p>The variadic library has these blocks:</p>
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image398.png" style="width:115px; height:40px">
These are versions of the associative
operators and, and or that take any number of inputs instead of exactly
two inputs. As with any variadic input, you can also drop a list of
values onto the arrowheads instead of providing the inputs one at a time
As of version 8.0, the arithmetic operators sum, product, minimum, and
maximum are no longer included, because the primitive operators +. ×,
min, and max are themselves variadic.
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image399.png" style="width:699px; height:106px">
The colors and crayons library has these
blocks:
<p>It is intended as a more powerful replacement for the primitive set pen
block, including <em>first class color</em> support; HSL color specification as
a better alternative to the HSV that Snap*!* inherits from JavaScript; a
“fair hue” scale that compensates for the eye’s grouping a wide range of
light frequencies as green while labelling mere slivers as orange or
yellow; the X11/W3C standard color names; RGB in hexadecimal; a linear
color scale (as in the old days, but better) based on fair hues and
including shades (darker colors) and grayscale. Another linear scale is
a curated set of 100 “crayons,” explained further on the next page.</p>

Colors are created by the block (for direct user
selection), the color from block to specify a color numerically, or by ,
which reports the color currently in use by the pen. The from color
block reports names or numbers associated with a color:

Colors can be created from other colors:
<p>The three blocks with pen in their names are improved versions of
primitive Pen blocks. In principle set pen, for example, could be
implemented using a (hypothetical) set pen to color composed with the
color from block, but in fact set pen benefits from knowing how the pen
color was set in its previous invocation, so it’s implemented separately
from color from. Details in Appendix A.</p>

The recommended way to choose a color is from one of two
linear scales: the continuous *color numbers* and the discrete
*crayons:*

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image418.png" style="width:384px; height:20px">
Color numbers are based on *fair hues,* a
modification of the spectrum (rainbow) hue scale that devotes less space
to green and more to orange and yellow, as well as promoting brown to a
real color. Here is the normal hue scale, for reference:
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image419.png" style="width:384px; height:20px">
Here is the fair hue scale:
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image416.png" style="width:480px; height:20px">
Here is the color number scale:
<p>(The picture is wider so that pure spectral colors line up with the fair
hue scale.)</p>
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image417.png" style="width:480px; height:20px">
And here are the 100 crayons:
<p>The color from block, for example, provides different pulldown menus
depending on which scale you choose:</p>
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image420.png" style="width:232px; height:33px">
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image421.png" style="width:679px; height:275px">
You can also type the crayon name: There
are many scales:
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image427.png" style="width:412px; height:183px">
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image428.png" style="width:590px; height:51px">
 The white slot at the end of some of the
blocks has two purposes. It can be used to add a transparency to a color
(0=opaque, 100=transparent):
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image432.png" style="width:675px; height:41px">
or it can be expanded to enter three or
four numbers for a vector directly into the block, so these are
equivalent:
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image436.png" style="width:719px; height:41px">
But note that a transparency number in a
four-number RGBA vector is on the scale 255=opaque, 0=transparent, so
the following are *not* equivalent:
<p>Set pen crayon to provides the equivalent of a box of 100 crayons. They
are divided into color groups, so the menu in the set pen crayon to
input slot has submenus. The colors are chosen so that starting
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image440.png" style="width:419px; height:49px">
from crayon 0, change pen crayon by 10
rotates through an interesting, basic set of ten colors:</p>
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image441.png" style="width:418px; height:27px">
Using change pen crayon by 5 instead
gives ten more colors, for a total of 20:
<p>(Why didn’t we use the colors of the 100-crayon Crayola™ box? A few
reasons, one of which is that some Crayola colors aren’t representable
on RGB screens. Some year when you have nothing else to do, look up
“color space” on Wikipedia. Also “crayon.” Oh, it’s deliberate that
change pen crayon by 5 doesn’t include white, since that’s the usual
stage background color. White is crayon 14.) Note that crayon 43 is</p>
