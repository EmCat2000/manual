# Snap<em>!</em> Manual Support Files

Stuff in this directory is used for compiling the manual and is _not_ considered content.

## `styles`, `html`, `tex`

These folders are used to hold content which gets copied into or compiled when building the full manual in whatever version is necessary.

## `scripts`

These scripts are run by Quarto (or manually) when compiling the manual.

### Collecting Index Defintions and Generating an Index

TODO. This needs to be finished.

### Making the Blocks References

TODO. We run the script, then a Quarto partial is used.

## Conversion

Mostly not necessary, but stuff used in converting the manual.
