# Student Accounts {.unnumbered}

When teachers bulk create accounts, the new accounts are automatically designed as a _student_ account. Student accounts work very similarly to standard accounts, but have a few different permissions.

## Differences from Standard accounts

* Student accounts cannot access the forum.
* A student's teacher has the ability to reset their password.

## Who controls a student account?
