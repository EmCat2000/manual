Welcome to the Snap*!* manual. This manual is a newly updated version. However, there are still many images and pages that need proper formatting.

You may wish to [download a pdf][pdf] of the manual.

**Version 8.0**

[Snap]{.snap} (formerly BYOB) is an extended reimplementation of Scratch
(<u>https://scratch.mit.edu</u>) that allows you to Build Your Own
Blocks. It also features ﬁrst class lists, first class procedures, first
class sprites, first class costumes, first class sounds, and first class
continuations. These added capabilities make it suitable for a serious
introduction to computer science for high school or college students.

In this manual we sometimes make reference to Scratch, e.g., to explain
how some [Snap]{.snap} feature extends something familiar in Scratch. It’s
very helpful to have some experience with Scratch before reading this
manual, but not essential.

To run [Snap]{.snap}, open a browser window and
visit https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap. The [Snap]{.snap} community web site
at https://snap.berkeley.edu is covered briefly in [@sec-appendix-community].


The manual is roughly organized into a few sections.

* Chapters 1 to 11 cover the primary features for writing programings in
Snap*!*. They are organized from introductory to advanced topics.
* Chapters 12 and 13 cover the user interface components of both the Snap*!* editor and the community site.
* The appendicies provide [documentation for every block in Snap*!*][blocks], as well as some of libraries provided.
