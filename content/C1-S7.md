# Script Variables

In the name example above, our project is going to
carry on an interaction with the user, and we want to remember their
name throughout the project. That's a good example of a situation in
which a *global* variable (the kind you make with the "Make a variable"
button) is appropriate. Another common example is a variable called
"score" in a game project. But sometimes you only need a variable
temporarily, during the running of a particular script. In that case you
can use the script variables block to make the variable:

As in the for block, you can click on an orange oval in the script
variables block without dragging to change its name. You can also make
more than one temporary variable by clicking on the right arrow at the
end of the block to add another variable oval:

## Renaming variables


There are several reasons why you might want to change the name of a
variable:

1.  It has a default name, such as the "a" in script variables or the
    "i" in for.

2.  It conflicts with another name, such as a global variable, that you
    want to use in the same script.

3.  You just decide a different name would be more self-documenting.

In the first and third case, you probably want to change the name
everywhere it appears in that script, or even in all scripts. In the
second case, if you've already used both variables in the script before
realizing that they have the same name, you'll want to look at each
instance separately to decide which ones to rename. Both of these
operations are possible by right-clicking or control-clicking on a
variable oval.

<img src="/content/assets/images/image109.png" style="width:133px; height:71px">
If you right-click on an orange oval in a
context in which the variable is *used,* then you are able to rename
just that one orange oval:

<img src="/content/assets/images/image111.png" style="width:143px; height:71px">
If you right-click on the place where the
variable is *defined* (a script variables block, the orange oval for a global variable in the Variables palette, or an orange oval that's built
into a block such as the "i" in for), then you are given two renaming
options, "rename" and "rename all." If you choose "rename," then the
name is changed only in that one orange oval, as in the previous case:

<img src="/content/assets/images/image113.png" style="width:164px; height:80px">
But if you choose "rename all," then the
name will be changed throughout the scope of the variable (the script
for a script variable, or everywhere for a global variable):
