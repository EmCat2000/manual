# Snap! Manual Conventions

## Technical Notes

* To add an index entry use `text...\index{entry name}`
* There should be no space after the index definition.
* Write "Snap!" as `Snap_!_` in markdown.

## Writing Code
* Variables in Snap! should be written as `<var>my variable</var>`, e.g. <var>counter</var>
* Write short code snippets inside `<code></code>` elements.

## Textifying Blocks

* Use `( )` to denote an empty input slot in a block.
* Place `()` around filled arguments, but do not leave spaces around the value. e.g. `move (10) steps`.
