The former is\nindicated by a rectangular box, the latter by a rounded box: . A third\nScratch type, Boolean (true/false), can be used in certain Control\nblocks with hexagonal slots.\n\nThe Snap*!* types are an expanded collection including Procedure, List,\nand Object types. Note that, with the exception of Procedure types, all\nof the input type shapes are just reminders to the user of what the\nblock expects; they are not enforced by the language.\n\n## The Snap*!* Input Type Dialog\n\nIn the Block Editor \\index{Block Editor} input name dialog \\index{input\nname dialog} , there is a right-facing arrowhead after the “Input name”\noption:\n\nClicking that arrowhead opens the “long” input name dialog \\index{long\ninput name dialog} :\n\n![image657.png](assets/image657.png) <!--  style=\"width:5.17083in;height:4.13542in\" / --> ![image658.png](assets/image658.png) <!--  style=\"width:0.19792in;height:0.19792in\" / --> There are twelve input type\nshapes \\index{input-type shapes}, plus three mutually exclusive\nmodifiers, listed in addition to the basic choice between title text and\nan input name. The default type, the one you get if you don’t choose\nanything else, is “Any,” meaning that this input slot is meant to accept\nany value of any type \\index{Any type}. If the size input in your block\nshould be an oval-shaped numeric slot rather than a generic rectangle,\nclick “Number.”\n\n![image659.png](assets/image659.png) <!--  style=\"width:6.82222in;height:2.75694in\" / --> The arrangement of the input\ntypes is systematic. As the pictures on this and the next page show,\neach row of types is a category, and parts of each column form a\ncategory. Understanding the arrangement will make it a little easier to\nfind the type you want.\n\n![image658.png](assets/image658.png) <!--  style=\"width:0.13194in;height:0.13194in\" / --> The second row of input types\ncontains the ones found in Scratch: Number, Any, and Boolean. (The\nreason these are in the second row rather than the ﬁrst will become\nclear when we look at the column arrangement.) The ﬁrst row contains the\nnew Snap*!* types other than procedures: Object, Text, and List. The\nlast two rows are the types related to procedures, discussed more fully\nbelow.\n\nThe List type \\index{List type} is used for ﬁrst class lists, discussed\nin Chapter IV above. The red rectangles inside the input slot are meant\nto resemble the appearance of lists as Snap*!* displays them on the\nstage: each element in a red rectangle.\n\nThe Object type \\index{Object type} is for sprites, costumes, sounds,\nand similar data types.\n\nThe Text type \\index{Text type} is really just a variant form of the Any\ntype, using a shape that suggests a text input.[5]\n\n### Procedure Types\n\nAlthough the procedure types are discussed more fully later, they are\nthe key to understanding the column arrangement in the input types. Like\nScratch, Snap*!* has three block shapes \\index{block shapes} :\njigsaw-piece \\index{jigsaw-piece blocks} for command blocks, oval\n\\index{oval blocks} for reporters, and hexagonal \\index{hexagonal\nblocks} for predicates. (A *predicate* is a reporter that always reports\ntrue or false.) In Snap*!* these blocks are ﬁrst class data; an input to\na block can be of Command type, Reporter type, or Predicate type. Each\nof these types is directly below the type of value that that kind of\nblock reports, except for Commands, which don’t report a value at all.\nThus, oval Reporters are related to the Any type, while hexagonal\nPredicates are related to the Boolean (true or false) type.\n\nThe unevaluated procedure types \\index{unevaluated procedure types} in\nthe fourth row are explained in Section VI.E below. In one handwavy\nsentence, they combine the *meaning* of the procedure types with the\n*appearance* of the reported value types two rows higher. (Of course,\nthis isn’t quite right for the C-shaped command input type, since\ncommands don’t ![image660.png](assets/image660.png) <!--  style=\"width:3.64583in;height:3.11389in\" / --> report values. But you’ll see\nlater that it’s true in spirit.)\n\n### ![image658.png](assets/image658.png) <!--  style=\"width:0.13194in;height:0.13194in\" alt=\"Macintosh HD:Users:bh:Desktop:gear-part.png\" / --> Pulldown inputs\n\n![image661.png](assets/image661.png) <!--  style=\"width:1.68056in;height:0.94097in\" / --> Certain primitive blocks have\n*pulldown* inputs \\index{pulldown input}, either *read-only*\n\\index{read-only pulldown input} *,* like the input to the touching\nblock:\n\n![image662.png](assets/image662.png) <!--  style=\"width:1.90208in;height:1.32292in\" / --> (indicated by the input slot\nbeing the same (cyan, in this case) color as the body of the block), or\n*writeable* \\index{writeable pulldown inputs} *,* like the input to the\npoint in direction block:\n\n(indicated by the white input slot), which means that the user can type\nin an arbitrary input instead of using the pulldown menu.\n\n![image663.png](assets/image663.png) <!--  style=\"width:0.83264in;height:0.65278in\" / --> ![image658.png](assets/image658.png) <!--  style=\"width:0.13194in;height:0.13194in\" alt=\"Macintosh HD:Users:bh:Desktop:gear-part.png\" / --> Custom blocks can\nalso have such inputs. To make a pulldown input, open the long form\ninput dialog, choose a text type (Any, Text, or Number) and click the\nicon in the bottom right corner, or control/right-click in the dialog.\nYou will see this menu:\n\n![image664.png](assets/image664.png) <!--  style=\"width:3.07639in;height:1.875in\" / --> Click\nthe read-only checkbox if you want a read-only pulldown input. Then from\nthe same menu, choose options… to get this dialog box:\n\nEach line in the text box represents one menu item. If the line does not\ncontain any of the characters =~{} then the text is both what’s shown in\nthe menu and the value of the input if that entry is chosen.\n\nIf the line contains an equal sign =, then the text to the left of the\nequal sign is shown in the menu, and the text to the right is what\nappears in the input slot if that entry is chosen, and is also the value\nof the input as seen by the procedure.\n\nIf the line consists of a tilde ~, then it represents a separator\n\\index{separator:menu} (a horizontal line) in the menu, used to divide\nlong menus into visible categories. There should be nothing else on the\nline. This separator is not choosable, so there is no input value\ncorresponding to it.\n\nIf the line ends with the two characters equal sign and open brace ={,\nthen it represents a *submenu.* The text before the equal sign is a name\nfor the submenu \\index{submenu}, and will be displayed in the menu with\nan arrowhead ► at the end of the line. This line is not clickable, but\nhovering the mouse over it displays the submenu next to the original\nmenu. A line containing a close brace } ends the submenu; nothing else\nshould be on that line. Submenus may be nested to arbitrary depth.\n\n### \n\nAlternatively, instead of giving a menu listing as described above, you\ncan put a JavaScript function that returns the desired menu in the\ntextbox. This is an experimental feature and requires that JavaScript be\nenabled in the Settings menu.  \nIt is also possible to get the special menus used in some primitive\nblocks, by choosing from the menu submenu: broadcast messages, sprites\nand stage, costumes, sounds, variables that can be set in this scope,\nthe play note piano keyboard, or the point in direction 360° dial.\nFinally, you can make the input box accept more than one line of text\n(that is, text including a newline character) from the special submenu,\neither “multi-line” for regular\n![image669.png](assets/image669.png) <!--  style=\"width:0.60417in;height:0.31944in\" alt=\"Macintosh HD:Users:bh:Desktop:little-options.png\" / --> text or “code”\nfor monospace-font computer code.\n\n![image670.png](assets/image670.png) <!--  style=\"width:0.13056in;height:0.1375in\" alt=\"Macintosh HD:Users:bh:Desktop:quarter-gear.png\" / --> ![image671.png](assets/image671.png) <!--  style=\"width:1.68056in;height:0.25694in\" alt=\"Macintosh HD:Users:bh:Desktop:Untitled script pic (1).png\" / --> If the\ninput type is something other than text, then clicking the button will\ninstead show this menu:\n\nAs an example, we want to make this block: The second input must be a\nread-only object menu:\n\nthe move (10) steps block. In the prototype block input at the top of\nthe script in the Block Editor, an input with name “size” and default\nvalue 10 looks like this:\n\nThe “single input” option: In Scratch, all inputs are in this category.\nThere is one input slot in the block as it appears in its palette. If a\nsingle input is of type Any, Number, Text, or Boolean, then you can\nspecify a default value \\index{default value} that will be shown in that\nslot in the palette, like the “10” in the move (10) steps block. In the\nprototype block at the top of the script in the Block editor, an\n\n### Input variants\n\nWe now turn to the three mutually exclusive options that come below the\ntype array.\n\n![image678.png](assets/image678.png) <!--  style=\"width:1.63889in;height:0.52083in\" alt=\"Macintosh HD:Users:bh:Desktop:default-value.png\" / --> \n\n![image679.png](assets/image679.png) <!--  style=\"width:1.76389in;height:0.93056in\" / --> ![image680.png](assets/image680.png) <!--  style=\"width:3.56944in;height:1.29444in\" / --> The “Multiple inputs” option:\nThe list block introduced earlier accepts any number of inputs to\nspecify the items of the new list. To allow this, Snap*!* introduces the\narrowhead notation (⏴⏵) that expands and contracts the block, adding and\nremoving input slots. (Shift-clicking on an arrowhead adds or removes\nthree input slots at once.) Custom blocks made by the Snap*!* user have\nthat capability, too. If you choose the “Multiple inputs” button, then\narrowheads \\index{arrowheads} will appear after the input slot in the\nblock. More or fewer slots (as few as zero) may be used. When the block\nruns, all of the values in all of the slots for this input name are\ncollected into a list, and the value of the input as seen inside the\nscript is that list of values:\n\nThe ellipsis \\index{ellipsis} (…) in the orange input slot name box in\nthe prototype indicates a multiple or *variadic* input \\index{variadic\ninput} .\n\nThe third category, “Upvar - make internal variable \\index{internal\nvariable} visible to caller \\index{make internal variable visible},”\nisn’t really an input at all, but rather a sort of output from the block\nto its user. It appears as an orange variable oval in the block, rather\nthan as an input slot. Here’s an example; the uparrow (**↑**)\n\\index{upward-pointing arrow} in the prototype indicates this kind of\ninternal variable name:\n\n➜\n\nThe variable i (in the block on the right above) can be dragged from the\nfor block \\index{for block} into the blocks used in its C-shaped command\nslot. Also, by clicking on the orange i, the user can change the name of\nthe variable as seen in the calling script (although the name hasn’t\nchanged inside the block’s definition). This kind of variable is called\nan *upvar* \\index{upvar} for short, because it is passed *upward* from\nthe custom block to the script that uses it.\n\nNote about the example: for is a primitive block, but it doesn’t need to\nbe. You’re about to see (next chapter) how it can be written in Snap*!*.\nJust give it a different name to avoid confusion, such as my for as\nabove.\n\n### Prototype Hints\n\nWe have mentioned three notations that can appear in an input slot in\nthe prototype to remind you of what kind of input this is. Here is the\ncomplete list of such notations:\n\n![image685.png](assets/image685.png) <!--  style=\"width:0.73472in;height:6.11806in\" / --> = default value … multiple\ninput ↑ upvar \\# number\n\n![image686.png](assets/image686.png) <!--  style=\"width:0.16319in;height:0.13542in\" / --> λ procedure types ⫶ list ?\nBoolean object ¶ multi-line text\n\n### Title Text and Symbols\n\n![image687.png](assets/image687.png) <!--  style=\"width:1.21875in;height:0.23472in\" / --> Some primitive blocks have\nsymbols \\index{icons in title text} as part of the block name: . Custom\nblocks can use symbols too. In the Block Editor, click the plus sign in\nthe prototype at the point where you want to insert the symbol. Then\nclick the title text picture below the text box that’s expecting an\ninput slot name. The dialog will then change to look like this:\n\n![image688.png](assets/image688.png) <!--  style=\"width:1.24444in;height:0.26667in\" / --> ![image689.png](assets/image689.png) <!--  style=\"width:2.03472in;height:1.26389in\" / --> The important part to notice\nis the arrowhead that has appeared at the right end of the text box.\nClick it to see the menu shown here at the left.\n\nChoose one of the symbols. The result will have the symbol you want: The\navailable symbols are, pretty much, the ones that are used in Snap*!*\nicons.\n\n![image690.png](assets/image690.png) <!--  style=\"width:2.03472in;height:1.26389in\" / --> But I’d like the arrow symbol\nbigger, and yellow, so I edit its name:\n\n![image691.png](assets/image691.png) <!--  style=\"width:1.19792in;height:0.27083in\" / --> This makes the symbol 1.5\ntimes as big as the letters in the block text, using a color with\nred-green-blue values of 255-255-150 (each between 0 and 255). Here’s\nthe result:\n\nThe size and color controls can also be used with text: $foo-8-255-120-0\nwill make a huge orange “foo.”\n\nNote the last entry in the symbol menu: “new line \\index{new line\ncharacter} .” This can be used in a block with many inputs to control\nwhere the text continues on another line, instead of letting Snap*!*\nchoose the line break itself.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"brand":{"brand":{"color":{"palette":{"dark-grey":"#222222","blue":"#003262"},"primary":"black"},"logo":{"medium":"images/snap-logo.png"},"typography":{"fonts":[{"family":"Open
