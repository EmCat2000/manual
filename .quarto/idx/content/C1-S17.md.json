{"title":"Etcetera","markdown":{"headingText":"Etcetera","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThis manual doesn't explain every block in detail. There are many more\nmotion blocks, sound blocks, costume and graphics effects blocks, and so\non. You can learn what they all do by experimentation, and also by\nreading the \"help screens\" that you can get by right-clicking or\ncontrol-clicking a block and selecting \"help...\" from the menu that\nappears. If you forget what palette (color) a block is, but you remember\nat least part of its name, type control-F and enter the name in the text\nblock that appears in the palette area.\n\nHere are the primitive blocks that don't exist in Scratch:\n\n![](assets/images/image135.png) <!-- {width=\"120px\" height=\"22px\"} -->\n![](assets/images/image136.png) <!-- {width=\"101px\" height=\"22px\"} -->\n reports a new costume consisting of\neverything that's drawn on the stage by any sprite. Right-clicking the\nblock in the scripting area gives the option to change it to if vector\nlogging is enabled. See page 116.\n\n![](assets/images/image137.png) <!-- {width=\"200px\" height=\"36px\"} -->\nPrint characters in the given point size on the stage,\nat the sprite's position and in its direction. The sprite moves to the\nend of the text. (That's not always what you want, but you can save the\nsprite's position before using it, and sometimes you need to know how\nbig the text turned out to be, in turtle steps.) If the pen is down, the\ntext will be underlined.\n\n![](assets/images/image138.png) <!-- {width=\"115px\" height=\"49px\"} -->\nTakes a sprite as input. Like stamp except\nthat the costume is stamped onto the selected sprite instead of onto the\nstage. (Does nothing if the current sprite doesn't overlap the chosen\nsprite.)\n\n![](assets/images/image139.png) <!-- {width=\"114px\" height=\"33px\"} -->\nTakes a sprite as input. Erases from that\nsprite's costume the area that overlaps with the current sprite's\ncostume. (Does not affect the costume in the chosen sprite's wardrobe,\nonly the copy currently visible.)\n\n![](assets/images/image140.png) <!-- {width=\"51px\" height=\"48px\"} -->\n![](assets/images/image141.png) <!-- {width=\"95px\" height=\"25px\"} -->\n\n![Icon Description automatically generated](assets/images/image142.png)\n<!-- {width=\"1.3298611111111112in\" height=\"0.42986111111111114in\"} -->\n See page 6. See page 17.\n\n![](assets/images/image143.png) <!-- {width=\"164px\" height=\"22px\"} -->\nReporter version of the if/else primitive command block.\nOnly one of the two branches is evaluated, depending on the value of the\nfirst input.\n\n![](assets/images/image144.png) <!-- {width=\"176px\" height=\"59px\"} -->\nLooping block like repeat but with an index variable.\n\n![](assets/images/image145.png) <!-- {width=\"132px\" height=\"28px\"} -->\nDeclare local variables in a script.\n\n![](assets/images/image146.png) <!-- {width=\"83px\" height=\"18px\"} -->\n![](assets/images/image147.png) <!-- {width=\"69px\" height=\"19px\"} -->\n![](assets/images/image148.png) <!-- {width=\"112px\" height=\"17px\"} -->\n See page 91.\n\n![](assets/images/image149.png) <!-- {width=\"263px\" height=\"20px\"} -->\nConstant true or false value. See page 12.\n\n![](assets/images/image153.png) <!-- {width=\"204px\" height=\"17px\"} -->\n\nCreate a primitive using JavaScript. (This block is disabled by default;\nthe user must check \"Javascript extensions\" in the setting menu *each\ntime* a project is loaded.)\n\n![](assets/images/image154.png) <!-- {width=\"157px\" height=\"151px\"} -->\nThe at block lets you examine the screen\npixel directly behind the rotation center of a sprite, the mouse, or an\narbitrary (x,y) coordinate pair dropped onto the second menu slot. The\nfirst five items of the left menu let you examine the color visible at\nthe position. (The \"RGBA\" option reports a list.) The \"sprites\" option\nreports a list of all sprites, including this one, any point of which\noverlaps this sprite's rotation center (behind or in front). This is a\nhyperblock with respect to its second input.\n\n![](assets/images/image158.png) <!-- {width=\"162px\" height=\"178px\"} -->\n![](assets/images/image162.png) <!-- {width=\"235px\" height=\"127px\"} -->\n![](assets/images/image163.png) <!-- {width=\"226px\" height=\"37px\"} -->\n Checks the data type of a value.\n\n![](assets/images/image164.png) <!-- {width=\"326px\" height=\"102px\"} -->\n\n\n![](assets/images/image166.png) <!-- {width=\"240px\" height=\"214px\"} -->\nTurn the text into a list, using the second input as\nthe delimiter between items. The default delimiter, indicated by the\nbrown dot in the input slot, is a single space character. \"Letter\" puts\neach character of the text in its own list item. \"Word\" puts each word\nin an item. (Words are separated by any number of consecutive space,\ntab, carriage return, or newline characters.) \"Line\" is a newline\ncharacter (0xa); \"tab\" is a tab character (0x9); \"cr\" is a carriage\nreturn (0xd). \"Csv\" and \"json\" split formatted text into lists of lists;\nsee page 54. \"Blocks\" takes a script as the first input, reporting a\nlist structure representing the structure of the script. See Chapter XI.\n\n![](assets/images/image170.png) <!-- {width=\"142px\" height=\"18px\"} -->\nFor lists, reports true only if its two\ninput values are the very same list, so changing an item in one of them\nis visible in the other. (For =, lists that look the same are the same.)\nFor text strings, uses case-sensitive comparison, unlike =, which is\ncase-independent.\n\n![](assets/images/image171.png) <!-- {width=\"275px\" height=\"18px\"} -->\nThese *hidden* blocks can be found with\nthe relabel option of any dyadic arithmetic block. They're hidden partly\nbecause writing them in Snap<em>!</em> is a good, pretty easy programming\nexercise. Note: the two inputs to atan2 are Δ*x* and Δ*y* in that order,\nbecause we measure angles clockwise from north. Max and min are\n*variadic;* by clicking the arrowhead, you can provide additional\ninputs.\n\n![Logo Description automatically generated with medium confidence](assets/images/image177.png)\n<!-- {width=\"0.63in\" height=\"0.19in\"} -->\n![A picture containing text, monitor, screenshot Description automatically generated](assets/images/image178.png)\n<!-- {width=\"0.63in\" height=\"0.19in\"} -->\n![Logo Description automatically generated](assets/images/image179.png)\n<!-- {width=\"0.63in\" height=\"0.19in\"} -->\nSimilarly, these hidden predicates can be found by\nrelabeling the relational predicates.\n\n![](assets/images/image180.png) <!-- {width=\"523px\" height=\"59px\"} -->\n**Metaprogramming (see Chapter** **XI. ,\npage** **101)**\n\nThese blocks support *metaprogramming,* which means manipulating blocks\nand scripts as data. This is not the same as manipulating procedures\n(see Chapter VI. ), which are what the blocks *mean;* in metaprogramming\nthe actual blocks, what you see on the screen, are the data. This\ncapability is new in version 8.0.\n\n**First class list blocks (see Chapter IV, page 46):**\n\n![](assets/images/image190.png) <!-- {width=\"731px\" height=\"210px\"} -->\n\n\n**\\\n**![](assets/images/image224.png) <!-- {width=\"80px\" height=\"20px\"} -->\n ![](assets/images/image225.png) <!-- {width=\"137px\" height=\"20px\"} -->\n **report the sprite or mouse position as a two-item\nvector (x,y).**\n\n![](assets/images/image226.png) <!-- {width=\"575px\" height=\"31px\"} -->\n**First class procedure blocks (see Chapter VI, page**\n**65):**\n\n![](assets/images/image240.png) <!-- {width=\"512px\" height=\"33px\"} -->\n![](assets/images/image246.png) <!-- {width=\"419px\" height=\"31px\"} -->\n**First class continuation blocks (see Chapter X,\npage** **93):**\n\n**First class sprite, costume, and sound blocks (see Chapter VII, page**\n**73):**\n\n![](assets/images/image250.png) <!-- {width=\"565px\" height=\"206px\"} -->\n\n\n**Scenes:**\n\n![](assets/images/image280.png) <!-- {width=\"228px\" height=\"127px\"} -->\nThe major new feature of version 7.0 is *scenes:* A\nproject can include within it sub-projects, called scenes, each with its\nown stage, sprites, scripts, and so on. This block makes another scene\nactive, replacing the current one.\n\nNothing is automatically shared between scenes: no sprites, no blocks,\nno variables. But the old scene can send a message to the new one, to\nstart it running, with optional payload as in broadcast (page 23).\n\n![](assets/images/image281.png) <!-- {width=\"244px\" height=\"30px\"} -->\n![](assets/images/image282.png) <!-- {width=\"300px\" height=\"50px\"} -->\n**In particular, you can say**\n\n> **if the new scene expects to be started with a green flag signal.**\n\n**\\\nThese aren't new blocks but they have a new feature:**\n\nThese accept two-item (x,y) lists as input, and have extended menus\n(also including other sprites):\n\n![](assets/images/image286.png) <!-- {width=\"718px\" height=\"108px\"} -->\n\"Center\" means the center of the stage,\nthe point at (0,0). \"Direction\" is in the point in direction sense, the\ndirection that would leave this sprite pointing toward another sprite,\nthe mouse, or the center. \"Ray length\" is the distance from the center\nof this sprite to the nearest point on the other sprite, in the current\ndirection.\n\n![](assets/images/image296.png) <!-- {width=\"247px\" height=\"136px\"} -->\nThe stop block has two extra menu choices. Stop this\nblock is used inside the definition of a custom block to stop just this\ninvocation of this custom block and continue the script that called it.\nStop all but this script is good at the end of a game to stop all the\ngame pieces from moving around, but keep running this script to provide\nthe user's final score. The last two menu choices add a tab at the\nbottom of the block because the current script can continue after it.\n\n![](assets/images/image300.png) <!-- {width=\"232px\" height=\"102px\"} -->\nThe new \"pen trails\" option is true if the\nsprite is touching any drawn or stamped ink on the stage. Also, touching\nwill not detect hidden sprites, but a hidden sprite can use it to detect\nvisible sprites.\n\n![](assets/images/image304.png) <!-- {width=\"102px\" height=\"27px\"} -->\n![](assets/images/image305.png) <!-- {width=\"234px\" height=\"29px\"} -->\nThe video block has a snap option that takes a snapshot\nand reports it as a costume. It is hyperized with\n![](assets/images/image306.png) <!-- {width=\"101px\" height=\"27px\"} -->\nrespect to its second input.\n\n![](assets/images/image307.png) <!-- {width=\"136px\" height=\"320px\"} -->\nThe \"neg\" option is a monadic negation\noperator, equivalent to . \"lg\" is log~2~. \"id\" is the identity function,\nwhich reports its input. \"sign\" reports 1 for positive input, 0 for zero\ninput, or -1 for negative input.\n\n![](assets/images/image311.png) <!-- {width=\"315px\" height=\"53px\"} -->\n\n\n![](assets/images/image313.png) <!-- {width=\"361px\" height=\"117px\"} -->\n\n\n![](assets/images/image325.png) <!-- {width=\"213px\" height=\"159px\"} -->\nExtended mouse interaction events, sensing\nclicking, dragging, hovering, etc. The \"stopped\" option triggers when\nall scripts are stopped, as with the stop button; it is useful for\nrobots whose hardware interface must be told to turn off motors. A when\nI am stopped script can run only for a limited time.\n\n![](assets/images/image329.png) <!-- {width=\"276px\" height=\"165px\"} -->\n\n\nExtended broadcast: Click the right arrowhead to direct the message to a\nsingle sprite or the stage. Click again to add any value as a payload to\nthe message.\n\n![](assets/images/image341.png) <!-- {width=\"363px\" height=\"174px\"} -->\n![](assets/images/image351.png) <!-- {width=\"175px\" height=\"92px\"} -->\nExtended when I receive: Click the right\narrowhead to expose a script variable (click on it to change its name,\nlike any script variable) that will be set to the data of a matching\nbroadcast. If the first input is set to \"any message,\" then the data\nvariable will be set to the message, if no payload is included with the\nbroadcast, or to a two-item list containing the message and the payload.\n\n![A picture containing text, clipart Description automatically\ngenerated](assets/images/image355.png)\n<!-- {width=\"1.68in\" height=\"0.38in\"} -->\n If the input is set to \"any key,\" then a right\narrowhead appears:\n\n![](assets/images/image356.png) <!-- {width=\"216px\" height=\"40px\"} -->\n![](assets/images/image357.png) <!-- {width=\"175px\" height=\"36px\"} -->\nand if you click it, a script variable\n> key is created whose value is the key that was pressed. (If the key is\n> one that' represented in the input menu by a word or phrase, e.g.,\n> \"enter\" or \"up arrow,\" then the value of key will be that word or\n> phrase, *except for* the space character, which is represented as\n> itself in key.)\\\n![](assets/images/image358.png) <!-- {width=\"297px\" height=\"66px\"} -->\n\n\n![](assets/images/image362.png) <!-- {width=\"571px\" height=\"84px\"} -->\n![](assets/images/image366.png) <!-- {width=\"535px\" height=\"106px\"} -->\n![](assets/images/image370.png) <!-- {width=\"611px\" height=\"279px\"} -->\n\n\n![](assets/images/image376.png) <!-- {width=\"140px\" height=\"223px\"} -->\n![](assets/images/image380.png) <!-- {width=\"564px\" height=\"97px\"} -->\nThese ask features and more in the Menus\nlibrary.\n\nThe of block has an extended menu of attributes of a sprite.
