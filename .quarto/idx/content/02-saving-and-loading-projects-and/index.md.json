{"title":"Saving and Loading Projects and Media","markdown":{"headingText":"Saving and Loading Projects and Media","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nAfter you’ve created a project, you’ll want to save it, so that you can\nhave access to it the next time you use Snap*!*. There are two ways to\ndo that. You can save a project on your own computer, or you can save it\nat the Snap*!* web site. The advantage of saving on the net is that you\nhave access to your project even if you are using a different computer,\nor a mobile device such as a tablet or smartphone. The advantage of\nsaving on your computer is that you have access to the saved project\nwhile on an airplane or otherwise not on the net. Also, cloud projects\nare limited in size, but you can have all the costumes and sounds you\nlike if you save locally. This is why we have multiple ways to save.\n\n<span id=\"saveas\" class=\"anchor\"></span>![image487.png](assets/image487.png) <!--  style=\"width:3.54861in;height:2.57639in\" / --> In either case, if you choose\n“Save as…” from the File menu. You’ll see something like this:\n\n(If you are not logged in to your Snap*!* cloud account, Computer will\nbe the only usable option.) The text box at the bottom right of the Save\ndialog allows you to enter project notes that are saved with the\nproject.\n\n## Local Storage\n\nClick on Computer and Snap*!*’s Save Project dialog window will be\nreplaced by your operating system’s standard save window. If your\nproject has a name, that name will be the default filename if you don’t\ngive a different name. Another, equivalent way to save to disk is to\nchoose “Export project” from the File menu.\n\n## ![image488.png](assets/image488.png) <!--  style=\"width:1.23403in;height:2.32986in\" / --> Creating a Cloud Account \\index{cloud storage} \n\n![image489.png](assets/image489.png) <!--  style=\"width:0.29167in;height:0.16667in\" / --> The other possibility is to\nsave your project “in the cloud,” \\index{save your project in the cloud}\nat the Snap*!* web site. In order to do this, you need an account with\nus. Click on the Cloud button \\index{Cloud button} ( ) in the Tool Bar.\nChoose the “Signup…” option. This will show you a window that looks like\nthe picture at the right.\n\nYou must choose a user name \\index{user name} that will identify you on\nthe web site, such as Jens or bh. If you’re a Scratch user, you can use\nyour Scratch name for Snap*!* too. If you’re a kid, don’t pick a user\nname that includes your family name, but first names or initials are\nokay. Don’t pick something you’d be embarrassed to have other users (or\nyour parents) see! If the name you want is already taken, you’ll have to\nchoose another one. You must also supply a password.\n\nWe ask for your month and year of birth; we use this information only to\ndecide whether to ask for your own email address or your parent’s email\naddress. (If you’re a kid, you shouldn’t sign up for anything on the\nnet, not even Snap*!*, without your parent’s knowledge.) We do not store\nyour birthdate information on our server; it is used on your own\ncomputer only during this initial signup. We do not ask for your *exact*\nbirthdate, even for this one-time purpose, because that’s an important\npiece of personally identifiable information.\n\nWhen you click OK, an email will be sent to the email address you gave,\nasking you to verify (by clicking a link) that it’s really your email\naddress. We keep your email address on file so that, if you forget your\npassword, we can send you a password-reset link. We will also email you\nif your account is suspended for violation of the Terms of Service. We\ndo not use your address for any other purpose. You will never receive\nmarketing emails of any kind through this site, neither from us nor from\nthird parties. If, nevertheless, you are worried about providing this\ninformation, do a web search for “temporary email.”\n\nFinally, you must read and agree to the Terms of Service \\index{Terms of\nService} . A quick summary: Don’t interfere with anyone else’s use of\nthe web site, and don’t put copyrighted media or personally identifiable\ninformation in projects that you share with other users. And we’re not\nresponsible if something goes wrong. (Not that we *expect* anything to\ngo wrong; since Snap*!* runs in JavaScript in your browser, it is\nstrongly isolated from the rest of your computer. But the lawyers make\nus say this.)\n\n## Saving to the Cloud\n\nOnce you’ve created your account, you can log into it using the “Login…”\noption from the Cloud menu:\n\n![image490.png](assets/image490.png) <!--  style=\"width:1.6875in;height:2.02778in\" / --> Use\nthe user name and password that you set up earlier. If you check the\n“Stay signed in” box, then you will be logged in automatically the next\ntime you run Snap*!* from the same browser on the same computer. Check\nthe box if you’re using your own computer and you don’t share it with\nsiblings. *Don’t* check the box if you’re using a public computer at the\nlibrary, at school, etc.\n\nOnce logged in, you can choose the “Cloud” option in the “Save Project”\ndialog shown on page [37](#saveas). You enter a project name, and\noptionally project notes; your project will be saved online and can be\nloaded from anywhere with net access. The project notes will be visible\nto other users if you publish your project.\n\n## Loading Saved Projects \\index{loading saved projects} \n\nOnce you’ve saved a project, you want to be able to load it back into\nSnap*!*. There are two ways to do this:\n\n1\\. If you saved the project in your online Snap*!* account, choose the\n“Open…” option from the File menu. Choose the “Cloud” button, then\nselect your project from the list in the big text box and click OK, or\nchoose the “Computer” button to open an operating system open dialog. (A\nthird button, “Examples,” lets you choose from example projects that we\nprovide. You can see what each of these projects is about by clicking on\nit and reading its project notes.)\n\n2\\. If you saved the project as an XML file on your computer, choose\n“Import…” from the File menu. This will give you an ordinary browser\nfile-open window, in which you can navigate to the file as you would in\nother software. Alternatively, find the XML file on your desktop, and\njust drag it onto the Snap*!* window.\n\nThe second technique above also allows you to import media (costumes and\nsounds) into a project. Just choose “Import…” and then select a picture\nor sound file instead of an XML file.\n\nSnap*!* can also import projects created in BYOB 3.0 or 3.1, or (with\nsome effort; see our web site) in Scratch 1.4, 2.0 or 3.0. Almost all\nsuch projects work correctly in Snap*!*, apart from a small number of\nincompatible blocks.\n\nIf you saved projects in an earlier version of Snap*!* using the\n“Browser” option, then a Browser button will be shown in the Open dialog\nto allow you to retrieve those projects. But you can save them only with\nthe Computer and Cloud options.\n\n## If you lose your project, do this first!\n\n![image384.png](assets/image384.png) <!--  style=\"width:0.31944in;height:0.18056in\" alt=\"Macintosh HD:Users:bh:Desktop:Dropbox:manual (1):filebutton.png\" / --> If\nyou are still in **Snap*!*** and realize that you’ve loaded another\nproject without saving the one you were working on: ***Don’t edit the\nnew project.*** From the File menu choose the Restore unsaved project\noption \\index{Restore unsaved project option}.\n\nRestore unsaved project will also work if you log out of Snap*!* and\nlater log back in, as long as you don’t edit another project meanwhile.\nSnap*!* remembers only the most recent project that you’ve edited (not\njust opened, but actually changed in the project editor).\n\nIf your project on the cloud is missing, empty, or otherwise broken and\nisn’t the one you edited most recently, or if Restore unsaved project\nfails: ***Don’t edit the broken project.*** In the Open… box, enter your\nproject name, then push the Recover button \\index{recover button}. *Do\nthis right away,* because we save only the version before the most\nrecent, and the latest before today. So don’t keep saving bad versions;\nRecover right away. The Recover feature works only on a project version\nthat you actually saved, so Restore unsaved project is your first choice\nif you switch away from a project without saving it.\n\nTo help you remember to save your projects, when you’ve edited the\nproject and haven’t yet saved it, Snap*!* displays a pencil icon to the\nleft of the project name on the toolbar at the top of the window:\n\nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn\n\n## Private and Public Projects\n\nBy default, a project you save in the cloud is private; only you can see\nit. There are two ways to make a project available to others. If you\nshare a project, you can give your friends a project URL (in your\nbrowser’s URL bar after you open the project) they can use to read it.\nIf you publish a project, it will appear on the Snap*!* web site, and\nthe whole world can see it. In any case, nobody other than you can ever\noverwrite your project; if others ask to save it, they get their own\ncopy in their own account.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"brand":{"brand":{"color":{"palette":{"dark-grey":"#222222","blue":"#003262"},"primary":"black"},"logo":{"medium":"images/snap-logo.png"},"typography":{"fonts":[{"family":"Open
