{"title":"Sprites and Parallelism","markdown":{"headingText":"Sprites and Parallelism","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nJust below the stage is the \"new sprite\" button . Click the button to\nadd a new sprite to the stage. The new sprite will appear in a random\nposition on the stage, with a random color, but always facing to the\nright.\n\nEach sprite has its own scripts. To see the scripts for a particular\nsprite in the scripting area, click on the picture of that sprite in the\n*sprite corral* in the bottom right corner of the window. Try putting\none of the following scripts in each sprite's scripting area:\n\n![](assets/images/image26.png) <!-- {width=\"149px\" height=\"95px\"} -->\n\n![](assets/images/image27.png) <!-- {width=\"148px\" height=\"112px\"} -->\n\n\nWhen you click the green flag, you should see one sprite rotate while\nthe other moves back and forth. This experiment illustrates the way\ndifferent scripts can run in parallel. The turning and the moving happen\ntogether. Parallelism can be seen with multiple scripts of a single\nsprite also. Try this example:\n\n![](assets/images/image28.png) <!-- {width=\"166px\" height=\"84px\"} -->\n\n![](assets/images/image29.png) <!-- {width=\"166px\" height=\"86px\"} -->\n\n\nWhen you press the space key, the sprite should move forever in a\ncircle, because the move and turn blocks are run in parallel. (To stop\nthe program, click the red stop sign at the right end of the tool bar.)\n\n## Costumes and Sounds\n\nTo change the appearance of a sprite, paint or import a new *costume* for it. To paint a costume, click on the Costumes tab above the scripting area, and click the paint button. ![](assets/images/image32.png\")\n<!-- {width=\"28px\" height=\"16px\"} -->\nThe *Paint Editor* that appears is explained on page 128. There are three ways to import a costume. First select the desired sprite in the sprite corral. Then, one way is to click on the file icon in the tool bar, then choose the ![](assets/images/image30.png) <!-- {width=\"31px\" height=\"21px\"} --> \"Costumes...\"menu item. You will see a list of costumes from the public media library, and can choose one. The second way, for a\ncostume stored on your own computer, is to click on the file icon and\nchoose the \"Import...\" menu item. You can then select a file in any\npicture format (PNG, JPEG, etc.) supported by your browser. The third\nway is quicker if the file you want is visible on the desktop: Just drag\nthe file onto the Snap<em>!</em> window. In any of these cases, the scripting\narea will be replaced by something like this:\n\n![](assets/images/image31.png) <!-- {width=\"170px\" height=\"180px\"} -->\n\nJust above this part of the window is a set of three tabs: Scripts,\nCostumes, and Sounds. You'll see that the Costumes tab is now selected.\nIn this view, the sprite's *wardrobe,* you can choose whether the sprite\nshould wear its Turtle costume or its Alonzo costume. (Alonzo, the\nSnap<em>!</em> mascot, is named after Alonzo Church, a mathematician who\ninvented the idea of procedures as data, the most important way in which\nSnap<em>!</em> is different from Scratch.) You can give a sprite as many\ncostumes as you like, and then choose which it will wear either by\nclicking in its wardrobe or by using the ![](assets/images/image34.png\")\n<!-- {width=\"180px\" height=\"25px\" }--> or\n![](assets/images/image35.png) <!-- {width=\"90px\" height=\"23px\"} --> block in a script. (Every costume has a number as well as a name. The next costume block selects\nthe next costume by number; after the highest-numbered costume it\nswitches to costume 1. The Turtle, costume 0, is never chosen by next\ncostume.) The Turtle costume is the only one that changes color to match\na change in the sprite's pen color\nProtip: ![](assets/images/image33.png) <!-- {width=\"173px\" height=\"27px\"} --> switches to the *previous*\ncostume, wrapping like next costume.\n\n\nIn addition to its costumes, a sprite can\nhave *sounds;* the equivalent for sounds of the sprite's wardrobe is\ncalled its *jukebox.* Sound files can be imported in any format (WAV,\nOGG, MP3, etc.) supported by your browser. Two blocks accomplish the\ntask of playing sounds. If you would like a script to continue running\nwhile the sound is playing, use the block ![](assets/images/image39.png) <!-- {width=\"119\" height=\"25\"} -->\n. In contrast, you can use the ![](assets/images/image38.png) <!-- {width=\"182px\" height=\"25px\"} -->\nblock to wait for the sound's completion before continuing the rest of\nthe script.\n\n## Inter-Sprite Communication with Broadcast\n\nEarlier we saw an example of two sprites moving at the same time. In a\nmore interesting program, though, the sprites on stage will *interact*\nto tell a story, play a game, etc. Often one sprite will have to tell\nanother sprite to run a script. Here's a simple example:\n\n\n![](assets/images/image41.png) <!-- {width=\"55px\" height=\"107px\"} -->\n\n![](assets/images/image42.png) <!-- {width=\"267px\" height=\"145px\"} -->\n\n![](assets/images/image43.png) <!-- {width=\"119px\" height=\"83px\"} -->\n![](assets/images/image44.png) <!-- {width=\"146px\" height=\"58px\"} -->\n\n\nIn the block ![](assets/images/image40.png) <!-- {width=\"165px\" height=\"24px\"} -->, the word \"bark\" is just an arbitrary name I made up. When you click on the downward arrowhead in that input slot, one of the choices (the only choice, the first time) is \"new,\" which then prompts you to enter a name for the new broadcast. When this block is run, the chosen message is sent to *every* sprite, which is why the block is called \"broadcast.\" (But if you click the\nright arrow after the message name, the block becomes ![](assets/images/image45.png) <!-- {width=\"172\" height=\"19\"} -->\n, and you can  change it to ![](assets/images/image46.png) <!-- {width=\"173px\" height=\"18px\"} -->Â to send the message just to one sprite.) In this program,\nthough, only one sprite has a script to run when that broadcast is sent,\nnamely the dog. Because the boy's script uses broadcast and wait rather\nthan just broadcast, the boy doesn't go on to his next say block until\nthe dog's script finishes. That's why the two sprites take turns\ntalking, instead of both talking at once. In Chapter VII, \"Object-Oriented Programming with Sprites,\" you'll see a more flexible way to send a message to a specific sprite using the tell and ask blocks.\n\nNotice, by the way, that the say block's first input slot is rectangular\nrather than oval. This means the input can be any text string, not only\na number. In text input slots, a space character is shown as a brown\ndot, so that you can count the number of spaces between words, and in\nparticular you can tell the difference between an empty slot and one\ncontaining spaces. The brown dots are *not* shown on the stage if the\ntext is displayed.\n\nThe stage has its own scripting area. It can be selected by clicking on\nthe Stage icon at the left of the sprite corral. Unlike a sprite,\nthough, the stage can't move. Instead of costumes, it has *backgrounds:*\npictures that fill the entire stage area. The sprites appear in front of\nthe current background. In a complicated project, it's often convenient\nto use a script in the stage's scripting area as the overall director of\nthe action.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"brand":{"brand":{"color":{"palette":{"dark-grey":"#222222","blue":"#003262"},"primary":"black"},"logo":{"medium":"images/snap-logo.png"},"typography":{"fonts":[{"family":"Open
