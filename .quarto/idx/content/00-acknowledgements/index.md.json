Jens cut his teeth in the company of the Smalltalk pioneers:\nAlan Kay \\index{Kay, Alan}, Dan Ingalls \\index{Ingalls, Dan}, and the\nrest of the gang who invented personal computing and object oriented\nprogramming in the great days of Xerox PARC \\index{Xerox PARC}. He\nworked with John Maloney \\index{Maloney, John}, of the MIT\n\\index{Massachusetts Institute of Technology} Scratch Team\n\\index{Scratch Team}, who developed the Morphic \\index{Morphic}\ngraphics framework that’s still at the heart of Snap*!*.\n\n***The brilliant design of Scratch, from the Lifelong Kindergarten\nGroup*** \\index{Lifelong Kindergarten Group} ***at the MIT Media Lab***\n\\index{Media Lab} ***, is crucial to* Snap*!. Our earlier version, BYOB,\nwas a direct modification of the Scratch source code.* Snap*! is a\ncomplete rewrite, but its code structure and its user interface remain\ndeeply indebted to Scratch. And the Scratch Team, who could have seen us\nas rivals, have been entirely supportive and welcoming to us.***\n\nBrian grew up at the MIT and Stanford Artificial Intelligence Labs\n\\index{MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab}, learning from Lisp inventor\nJohn McCarthy \\index{ McCarthy, John}, Scheme \\index{Scheme} inventors\nGerald J. Sussman \\index{Sussman, Gerald J.} and Guy Steele\n\\index{Steele, Guy}, and the authors of the world’s best computer\nscience book, *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*\n\\index{Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs} *,* Hal\nAbelson \\index{Abelson, Hal} and Gerald J. Sussman with Julie Sussman\n\\index{Sussman, Julie}, among many other heroes of computer science.\n(Brian was also lucky enough, while in high school, to meet Kenneth\nIverson \\index{Iverson, Kenneth E.}, the inventor of APL \\index{APL}.)\n\n***In the glory days of the MIT Logo Lab, we used to say, “Logo is Lisp\ndisguised as BASIC.” Now, with its first class procedures, lexical\nscope, and first class continuations,* Snap*! is Scheme disguised as\nScratch.***\n\nFour people have made such massive contributions to the implementation\nof Snap*!* that we have officially declared them members of the team:\nMichael Ball \\index{Ball, Michael} and Bernat Romagosa, in addition to\ncontributions throughout the project, have primary responsibility for\nthe web site and cloud storage \\index{Romagosa, Bernat}. Joan Guillén i\nPelegay \\index{Guillén i Pelegay, Joan} has contributed very careful and\nwise analysis of outstanding issues, including help in taming the\nmanagement of translations to non-English languages. Jadga Hügle\n\\index{Huegle, Jadga}, has energetically contributed to online\nmini-courses about Snap*!* and leading workshops for kids and for\nadults. Jens, Jadga, and Bernat are paid to work on Snap*!* by SAP,\nwhich also supports our computing needs.\n\nWe have been fortunate to get to know an amazing group of brilliant\nmiddle school(!) and high school students through the Scratch Advanced\nTopics forum, several of whom (since grown up) have contributed code to\nSnap*!*: Kartik Chandra \\index{Chandra, Kartik}, Nathan Dinsmore\n\\index{Dinsmore, Nathan}, Connor Hudson \\index{Hudson, Connor}, Ian\nReynolds \\index{Reynolds, Ian}, and Deborah Servilla \\index{Servilla,\nDeborah} . Many more have contributed ideas and alpha-testing bug\nreports. UC Berkeley students who’ve contributed code include Achal Dave\n\\index{Dave, Achal}. Kyle Hotchkiss \\index{Hotchkiss. Kyle}, Ivan\nMotyashov \\index{Motyashov, Ivan}, and Yuan Yuan \\index{Yuan, Yuan}.\nContributors of translations are too numerous to list here, but they’re\nin the “About…” box in Snap*!* itself.\n\nThis material is based upon work supported in part by the National\nScience Foundation under Grants No.\n1138596, 1143566, and 1441075; and in part by MioSoft, Arduino.org, SAP,\nand YC Research.

It also features ﬁrst class lists, ﬁrst class procedures, first\nclass sprites, first class costumes, first class sounds, and first class\ncontinuations. These added capabilities make it suitable for a serious\nintroduction to computer science for high school or college students.\n\nIn this manual we sometimes make reference to Scratch, e.g., to explain\nhow some Snap*!* feature extends something familiar in Scratch. It’s\nvery helpful to have some experience with Scratch before reading this\nmanual, but not essential.\n\nTo run Snap*!*, open a browser window and\nconnect to https://snap.berkeley.edu/run. The Snap*!* community web site\nat https://snap.berkeley.edu is not part of this manual’s scope.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["../../scripts/collect-index.lua"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
