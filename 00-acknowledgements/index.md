We have been extremely lucky in our mentors.
Jens cut his teeth in the company of the Smalltalk pioneers:
Alan Kay\index{Kay, Alan}, Dan Ingalls\index{Ingalls, Dan}, and the
rest of the gang who invented personal computing and object oriented
programming in the great days of Xerox PARC\index{Xerox PARC}. He
worked with John Maloney\index{Maloney, John}, of the MIT
\index{Massachusetts Institute of Technology} Scratch Team
\index{Scratch!Team@Scratch Team}, who developed the Morphic\index{Morphic}
graphics framework that’s still at the heart of [Snap]{.snap}.

<strong><em>The brilliant design of Scratch, from the Lifelong Kindergarten
Group\index{Lifelong Kindergarten Group} at the MIT Media Lab
\index{Media Lab}\index{MIT Media Lab}, is crucial to [Snap]{.snap}. Our earlier version, BYOB, was a direct modification of the Scratch source code. [Snap]{.snap} is a complete rewrite, but its code structure and its user interface remain deeply indebted to Scratch. And the Scratch Team, who could have seen us as rivals, have been entirely supportive and welcoming to us.</em></strong>

Brian grew up at the MIT and Stanford Artificial Intelligence Labs
\index{MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab}\index{Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab}, learning from Lisp inventor
John McCarthy\index{McCarthy, John}, Scheme\index{Scheme} inventors
Gerald J. Sussman\index{Sussman, Gerald J.} and Guy Steele
\index{Steele, Guy}, and the authors of the world’s best computer
science book, *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*
\index{Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs} *,* Hal
Abelson\index{Abelson, Hal} and Gerald J. Sussman with Julie Sussman
\index{Sussman, Julie}, among many other heroes of computer science.
(Brian was also lucky enough, while in high school, to meet Kenneth
Iverson\index{Iverson, Kenneth E.}, the inventor of APL\index{APL}.)

***In the glory days of the MIT Logo Lab, we used to say, “Logo is Lisp
disguised as BASIC.” Now, with its first class procedures, lexical
scope, and first class continuations,* Snap*! is Scheme disguised as
Scratch.***

Four people have made such massive contributions to the implementation
of [Snap]{.snap} that we have officially declared them members of the team:
Michael Ball\index{Ball, Michael} and Bernat Romagosa, in addition to
contributions throughout the project, have primary responsibility for
the web site and cloud storage\index{Romagosa, Bernat}. Joan Guillén i
Pelegay\index{Guillén i Pelegay, Joan} has contributed very careful and
wise analysis of outstanding issues, including help in taming the
management of translations to non-English languages. Jadga Hügle
\index{Huegle, Jadga}, has energetically contributed to online
mini-courses about [Snap]{.snap} and leading workshops for kids and for
adults. Jens, Jadga, and Bernat are paid to work on [Snap]{.snap} by SAP,
which also supports our computing needs.

We have been fortunate to get to know an amazing group of brilliant
middle school(!) and high school students through the Scratch Advanced
Topics forum, several of whom (since grown up) have contributed code to
[Snap]{.snap}: Kartik Chandra\index{Chandra, Kartik}, Nathan Dinsmore
\index{Dinsmore, Nathan}, Connor Hudson\index{Hudson, Connor}, Ian
Reynolds\index{Reynolds, Ian}, and Deborah Servilla\index{Servilla,
Deborah} . Many more have contributed ideas and alpha-testing bug
reports. UC Berkeley students who’ve contributed code include Achal Dave
\index{Dave, Achal}. Kyle Hotchkiss\index{Hotchkiss. Kyle}, Ivan
Motyashov\index{Motyashov, Ivan}, and Yuan Yuan\index{Yuan, Yuan}.
Contributors of translations are too numerous to list here, but they’re
in the “About…” box in [Snap]{.snap} itself.
